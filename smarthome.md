# Creating smart home DIY

## Idea: 
To have my apartement (and also, to some extent my summercottage) monitorable and somewhat manageable via network.

### Initial wishes:
- apartement:
  - temp & humidity monitoring
-* automatic (and remote) management of heapump, waterheater and radiators
* cameras
* door and windows open/close sensors

- cottage:
* remote (over GSM) temperature monitoring and switching radiators on/off

### later:
- electricity consumption monitoring



## How:
### Raspberry pie 3

### Install raspbian
